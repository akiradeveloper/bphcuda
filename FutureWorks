Since I have left the university, it is very difficult to continue maintaining this software.

If you are interested in this project, I will ask you to do the following tasks.

1. Tested on CUDA 4.0 and latest Thrust
Current Thrust library has discard iterator and much more sophisticated algorithm implementations.
If you are intereted in this software, please apply discard iterator to my codes,
and run on CUDA 4.0 and the latest Thrust.
I have only examined on CUDA 3.2 and Thrust 1.3.

2. Tested on better GPUs.
Unfortunately, we have not acquired high-end GPU. We have used GTS450, quite low-end as Fermi GPU.
So, it is our interest to see how fast this implementation is.
I guess using C2050 or C2070 will show 4x faster than current result which is only 3.6 times faster than CPU implementation.
If you have such luxuary, please run this software on your GPU and report the result.

Please "cd benchmark" and read README.
