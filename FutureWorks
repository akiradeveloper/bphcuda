Since I have left the university, it is very difficult to continue maintaining this software.

If you are interested in this project, I will ask you to do the following tasks.

1. Tested on CUDA 4.0 and latest Thrust
Current Thrust library has discard_iterator and much more sophisticated algorithm implementations.
If you are intereted in this software, please apply discard_iterator to my codes,
and run on CUDA 4.0 and the latest Thrust.
I have only examined on CUDA 3.2 and Thrust 1.3.

2. Tested on better GPUs.
Unfortunately, we have not acquired high-end GPU. We have used GTS450, quite low-end as Fermi GPU.
So, it is our interest to see how fast this implementation is.
I guess that using C2050 or C2070 will show 4-5x faster than current result using GTS450 which is only 3.6 times faster than CPU implementation. Using these high-end GPUs, We will get very fast implementation of BPH algorithm.
If you have such luxuary, please run this software on your GPU and report the result.
Please "cd benchmark" and read README, rake -T.
