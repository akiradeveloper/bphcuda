BPHCUDA
=======
BPH Algorithm on GPU

## What is BPH?
Boltzmann Particle Hydrodynamics.  
It's a very fast algorithm for fluid simulation 
and its applications are in the space.

There is Dr.Matsuda's presentation on BPH algorithm and its applications
in a workshop on Astrophysics
[Video and Slides](https://www.cps-jp.org/modules/mosir/player.php?v=20111027_matsuda).

See also download what-is-bph.pdf slides.

## Tested Environment
- Tested on single GTS 450 (Fermi,  2010)  
- Tested on single GTX 660 (Kelper, 2013)

Should be tested on more enviroments
with distributed nodes if possible.

Reports on tested on other GPUs
are welcome and will be granted as a contribution.

## Thanks
Dr. T. Matsuda and Dr. H. Isaka for Giving me  
* chance to implement BPH on GPU and  
* lectures on BPH algorithm itself and fundamental of fluid dynamics.
