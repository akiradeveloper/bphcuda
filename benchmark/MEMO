change remove_if to partition
but the result is the same.
in sjogreen the last 7 cells are empty and the 8th from the last end is very dense.
I think this is because of the speed of flow that reaches 7 mach number.
with is extreme speed the particle move almost 7 cells in a time step.

In addition
the time is 44ms for boundary
that is almost equal to that by remove_if algorithm.
I think these two are not far different.
